## **Clustering Analysis**
### **PCA Overview**
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dataset dimensions for clustering. Two principal components (PCA1 and PCA2) were extracted, revealing the following patterns:
- **PCA1**: Differentiates data based on travel speed and motorized travel modes (e.g., cars, motorcycles).
- **PCA2**: Highlights public transport usage and work-related trip purposes.

#### **Top Features in PCA Loadings**
- **PCA1**:
  - `mode_Voiture / Moto` (Weight: 0.5445)
  - `speed` (Weight: 0.4852)
  - `purpose_Sant√©` (Weight: 0.1341)
- **PCA2**:
  - `purpose_Travail / Rendez-vous d'affaires` (Weight: 0.6970)
  - `mode_Transport collectif` (Weight: 0.1496)

### **K-Means Clustering Results**
- **Clusters**:
  - **Cluster 0**: High-speed trips using motorized vehicles, predominantly for leisure and health purposes.
  - **Cluster 1**: Medium-speed trips involving walking or cycling, with a mix of purposes.
  - **Cluster 2**: Work-related trips using public transport or multi-modal travel.
- **Insights**:
  - Clear separation of clusters based on speed, purpose, and travel mode.
  - Effective for understanding behavioral patterns in multimodal travel.

### **DBSCAN Clustering Results**
- **Clusters**:
  - **Cluster 0**: Majority of trips with routine travel patterns.
  - **Cluster 1**: Smaller group of slower or geographically distinct trips.
  - **Outliers (-1)**: Unique trips or anomalies with low density.
- **Insights**:
  - DBSCAN identified outliers and natural groupings in the data.
  - Effective for capturing irregular travel patterns and unique behaviors.
